# Snyk

### **End-to-End Snyk Integration for Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)**

#### **Objective**:
The goal of this project is to integrate **Snyk** into the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) across different environments: **development**, **test**, **pre-production**, and **production**. The focus is on identifying and remediating vulnerabilities in source code, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure as code (IaC) while ensuring that the process is automated and seamless across all stages.

---

### **Technology Stack**:
- **Language**: Node.js (or any other backend language like Python, Java, etc.)
- **Version Control**: Git (GitHub, GitLab)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or similar
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform or AWS CloudFormation
- **IDE**: VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA
- **Security Tool**: Snyk

---

### **1. Development Environment: IDE Integration with VS Code/IntelliJ**

**Step 1.1**: Install Snyk Plugin in the IDE

- **For VS Code**:
  1. Open **Extensions** in VS Code.
  2. Search for **Snyk Security** and install it.
  
- **For IntelliJ IDEA**:
  1. Open **Settings** -> **Plugins**.
  2. Search for **Snyk Vulnerability Scanner** and install it.

**Step 1.2**: Authenticate Snyk in Your IDE

- After installing the plugin:
  1. Open the **Snyk** panel in the IDE.
  2. Sign in to your Snyk account (or create one).
  3. Generate an **API token** from the Snyk website and use it to authenticate in the IDE.

**Step 1.3**: Run Security Scans in Development

- Open your project in the IDE.
- Use the Snyk plugin to scan your dependencies, code, and configurations:
  - **For Node.js**: Snyk will scan `package.json` and `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`.
  - **For Java**: It scans the `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle) file.
  - **For Python**: It scans `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`.

**Step 1.4**: Fix Vulnerabilities

- Snyk will provide recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities, such as upgrading to a secure version of the library.
- Apply fixes directly from the IDE and re-scan to ensure all issues are resolved.

### **2. Test Environment: CI/CD Pipeline Integration**

#### **Step 2.1**: Integrate Snyk into Your CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Jenkins**:
   - Install the **Snyk Security** plugin in Jenkins.
   - Add a Snyk scan step in your `Jenkinsfile`:
     ```groovy
     pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
         stage('Install Dependencies') {
           steps {
             sh 'npm install'
           }
         }
         stage('Snyk Security Scan') {
           steps {
             snykSecurity()
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```

2. **GitLab CI**:
   - In your `.gitlab-ci.yml`, add a Snyk test stage:
     ```yaml
     stages:
       - test
     snyk-test:
       stage: test
       script:
         - npm install -g snyk
         - snyk test
       only:
         - merge_requests
     ```

3. **GitHub Actions**:
   - In your `.github/workflows/main.yml`, add Snyk testing:
     ```yaml
     name: CI Pipeline
     on: [push]
     jobs:
       snyk:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Run Snyk Test
           run: |
             npm install -g snyk
             snyk test
           env:
             SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
     ```

#### **Step 2.2**: Set Up API Token for CI/CD

- Configure **Snyk API token** as a secret or environment variable in the CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins credentials, GitHub Secrets, or GitLab CI variables).

#### **Step 2.3**: Running Scans and Failing Builds

- The pipeline will scan the code automatically whenever there’s a **commit** or **merge request**.
- Snyk will fail the build if critical vulnerabilities are found, preventing insecure code from moving forward.

### **3. Pre-Production: Container and Infrastructure Scanning**

#### **Step 3.1**: Docker Container Security Scanning

- **For Jenkins/GitLab/GitHub Actions**:
  1. Add Snyk to scan your Docker images:
     ```bash
     snyk container test <image_name>
     ```

2. **Sample Jenkinsfile** for Docker scanning:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
     agent any
     stages {
       stage('Build Docker Image') {
         steps {
           sh 'docker build -t my-app .'
         }
       }
       stage('Snyk Container Scan') {
         steps {
           sh 'snyk container test my-app'
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

#### **Step 3.2**: Scanning Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Files

- For **Terraform** or **AWS CloudFormation**:
  1. Add a Snyk IaC scan step to the pipeline:
     ```bash
     snyk iac test <path_to_terraform_file>
     ```

- **Sample GitLab CI pipeline** for Terraform:
  ```yaml
  stages:
    - security
  snyk-iac-test:
    stage: security
    script:
      - snyk iac test ./terraform
    only:
      - branches
  ```

### **4. Production Environment: Continuous Monitoring and Alerts**

#### **Step 4.1**: Set Up Snyk Continuous Monitoring

- After deploying your app to production, you can set up **Snyk Monitor** to track new vulnerabilities in real-time:
  ```bash
  snyk monitor
  ```

- This will create a monitored project in your Snyk dashboard that continuously checks for new vulnerabilities.

#### **Step 4.2**: Real-Time Alerts and Fix Suggestions

- Snyk will automatically alert you via email or dashboard notifications when new vulnerabilities are discovered in your production environment.
- Snyk also provides suggested fixes and allows you to create **automated fix pull requests** in your version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

---

### **End-to-End Workflow**

1. **Development** (VS Code/IntelliJ):
   - Developers scan their code and dependencies in real-time using the Snyk plugin.
   - Vulnerabilities are fixed locally before code is committed.

2. **Test Environment** (CI/CD):
   - Snyk automatically scans the code and dependencies during every push or pull request.
   - The pipeline fails if vulnerabilities are found, ensuring insecure code does not proceed to the next stage.

3. **Pre-Production**:
   - Docker containers and IaC (Terraform/AWS CloudFormation) files are scanned before deployment.
   - Snyk ensures that no vulnerable containers or insecure infrastructure configurations are promoted to production.

4. **Production**:
   - Snyk’s continuous monitoring feature tracks vulnerabilities in production environments.
   - Alerts are triggered if new issues are found, and automated remediation steps are suggested.

---

### **Benefits of This Integration**:
- **Early Detection**: Snyk helps catch vulnerabilities early in the development process, saving time and resources.
- **Automated Security**: Automated scans throughout the CI/CD pipeline reduce the risk of human error and ensure secure deployments.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Snyk scans code, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure, offering full-stack security across environments.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Continuous monitoring in production ensures that you stay protected even after deployment.

This project provides a full integration of Snyk into your development workflow, ensuring that security is embedded at every stage from development to production.
